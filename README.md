>## **What is Zk-Sync**
* ZkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum that offers low gas and fast transactions, without compromising on security. People can withdraw assets to Layer 1 at any time.
* The concept of zkSync is to provide a trustless and zero-compromise Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. The team achieves this through zkRollup technology, zerk-knowledge proofs, and on-chain data availability. The outcome is how users can send funds over zkSync without worrying over switching between layers, new deposit addresses, or friction.

>## **zkSync provides:**
1. Low gas: up to 1/100 of L1 gas & cheaper than using optimistic rollups.
1. High speeds: 2000+ transactions per second (tps) compared to 14tps on L1.
1. Security: secured by the main Ethereum blockchain.
1. Frictionless transfers: effortlessly move your crypto between L1 and Layer 2 without delays.

>## **What I have done in this repository:**
I have implemented the protocol that is used in zkSync between two parties which I learned after completing two courses of cryptozombies on zkSync.
It contains several steps such as:
* getting zkSync Provider
* initialising account
* registering account
* depositing to zkSync
* transfer process
* getting fee
* withdrawal to ethereum
* displaying zkSync balance
